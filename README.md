This is the practice code of machine learning
here we have made a spam mail prediction model using logistic regression model .
You just have to add the mail text in the input section and you will get output as Spam or Ham .
Hence we have successfuly created our Spam detection model 

used libraries :
      numpy
      PIL
      Image
      sklearn

The database file for the model is also uploaded as mail.csv
